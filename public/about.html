  <p>Hi, My name is Muhammad Raihan Haykal (22), you can call me Raihan. I live in South Tangerang, Indonesia. I'm new at Web development. However, i was went to collage about 4 years ago. but i didn't finished my collage. I quit my collage on the first semester for some reason.</p>
  <p>Long story short, after i quit my collage, i decided to find a job. Then i got a job at one of the Internet Service Provider (ISP) company in indonesia, First Media. I've work there for about 3 years. </p>
  <p>On my very first day worked there, i'm setting my goal for saving some of my money from my wage. Then, after i saving money for about 3 years,  i quit my job to start over my collage again, beacause i'm very passioned about IT.</p>
